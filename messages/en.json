    "bodyText": "My name is Sally Resch and I live in Södertälje, Sweden. As for alot of other people, the pandemic brought new horizons  and I found programming. Since the autumn of 2021, I studied to become a Java Developer/Fullstack at Stockholms Technical Institute and have now reached my goal of graduation. I seek employment as a developer as we speak. I have previously worked both as a manager in a kitchen and in food production but also as a chef and baker. These experiences has given me the opportunity to develop my problem solving skills and also made me aware of the importance of teamwork. As a person, I am a curious, observant, quality-driven teamplayer who is passionate about clear communication within the working group. I am attracted to innovation and I am confident of driving it forward together. To relax I play dungeons and dragons with friends, workout and experiment with food"
